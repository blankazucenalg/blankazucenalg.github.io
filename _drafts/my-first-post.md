Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

```javascript
var default = 'This is a javascript sample code';

function realStuff(param) {
  return param + ' is the real stuff';
}
```
