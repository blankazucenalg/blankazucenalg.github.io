Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

```javascript
var default = 'This is a javascript sample code';

function realStuff(param) {
  return param + ' is the real stuff';
}
```

<button onclick="runCode()">
  <i class="fa fa-play"></i>
  Run code
</button>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/4.13.0/d3.js"></script>
<script>
this.runCode = function() {
  d3.selectAll('pre').style('background-color', '#ddd');
}
</script>
